# LP-IP-Solver-Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a Visual Studio-based solver for **Linear Programming (LP)** and **Integer Programming (IP)** models. It supports multiple algorithms, sensitivity analysis, and input/output via text files. The final executable (`solve.exe`) is menu-driven and built using a .NET language.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Solve LP and IP models using various algorithms
- Perform sensitivity analysis and duality checks
- Handle infeasible and unbounded models
- Export canonical forms and tableau iterations
- Demonstrate functionality via video submission

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Visual Studio (.NET)
- C# (or other .NET language)
- GitHub for version control
- Text-based input/output
